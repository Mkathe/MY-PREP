        from 60 countries gather in Santa Fe to offer handmade
        masterworks. Every July, one of the world's largest
        folk-art festivals __ together artists from every

        legend, the first kites flew nearly 1,400 years ago. Since

        capable of flying halfway around the world in a mere
        four hours could soon exist. For engineers, the
        elimination of sonic booms __ one of the biggest
        challenges involved in building the new craft. Some of
        them claim, however, that they have found a way of
        reducing the amount of noise the planes make.

        the assembly-line model of car manufacturing. In the
        1920s, Ford's production method for the Model T
        transformed the automobile from a luxury item into a
        purchase that was affordable for the average
        consumer. Today, assembly-line production and bulk
        buying __ both the cost and construction time for
        prefabricated homes.
